# Quarterly inflation forecasting using FRED-QD Dataset in R

Test and train datasets were created. The training dataset was used to train three models (AR(1), simple linear regression & ridge regression models) and the testing data was used to compute the mean square error for each of the models. Simple linear regression had the least MSE among them.
